              <p>The Statue of Liberty's original torch is getting a new home.</p>
              <p>Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch took a beating from the weather and was replaced by a replica in 1984. It's been stored in the statue's pedestal ever since.</p>
              <p>But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a new Statue of Liberty Museum, which will open on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Island">Liberty Island</a> in May 2019. The torch was transported there by truck last week, along with a replica model of Lady Liberty's face.</p>
              <p>
                <em><q>Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved,</q></em> says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the relocation of the torch, <em><q>it is certainly the most important.</q></em>

              <h2>The history of the Statue of Liberty</h2>
              <p>Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is also a <a href = "https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/307"> UNESCO World Heritage site </a> under the designation of <em>Outstanding Universal Value</em>.</p>
              <p>Her full name is Liberty Enlightening the World, and she was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi">Frederic Auguste Bartholdi</a> and built by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Eiffel">Gustave Eiffel</a> -- yes, the same guy who built Paris's Eiffel Tower.</p>
              <p>Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of their nation's independence -- although, somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> formally unveiled her in 1886.</p>
              <p>Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who entered the United States as immigrants via neighboring Ellis Island.</p>
              <p><em><q>The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of freedom and democracy,</q></em> says John Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. That symbolic spirit inspired the decision to inscribe these famous lines on the statue's pedestal: <em><q>Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.</q></em></p>
              <p>In 2017, nearly <strong>4.5 million</strong> people visited Liberty Island.</p>
              <p>When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be <strong>26,000 square feet</strong> of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue's symbolism both in the US and around the world.</p>
              <p>The inspiration gallery, which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at Lower Manhattan, including the <a href="https://www.wtc.com/">World Trade Center</a>.</p>
